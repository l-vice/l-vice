## Hi there! 👋

I'm Luka, a data scientist based in Rome. I love building data-driven solutions that help businesses understand their customers better.

My work focuses on creating interpretable, data-driven models that uncover patterns, optimize decision-making, and bridge the gap between statistical theory and practice.

## About Me

I specialize in econometrics and machine learning, focusing on customer behavior modeling and predictive analytics. With several projects under my belt, I enjoy tackling complex problems using innovative solutions and advanced statistical techniques.
