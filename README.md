## Hi there! 👋

I'm Luka, a data scientist based in Rome. I love building data-driven solutions that help businesses understand their customers better.

My work focuses on creating interpretable, data-driven models that uncover patterns, optimize decision-making, and bridge the gap between statistical theory and practice.

## About Me

I specialize in econometrics and machine learning, focusing on customer behavior modeling and predictive analytics. With several projects under my belt, I enjoy tackling complex problems using innovative solutions and advanced statistical techniques.

## Skills & Technologies

r,cpp,py,latex

## My Projects

- [HMM_FX](https://github.com/l-vice/hmm_fx): Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Hidden Semi-Markov Models (HSMM) for FX regime detection. Identifies volatility states in EUR/USD and improves algorithmic mean-reversion performance through regime filtering. (Language: R)

- [YT_Engagement_Prediction](https://github.com/l-vice/lr_yt_pred): Predictive modeling of YouTube like/view ratio using Orange3 and R. Combines data cleaning, feature engineering, and ML model evaluation (Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost) for creator analytics. (Language: Python / R)

- [Garment_Worker_Productivity](https://github.com/l-vice/garment_workers_productivity): Classification models (LDA, QDA, kNN, RDA, logistic regression) for labor productivity prediction in garment manufacturing. Includes visualization, validation, and model comparison. (Language: R)

- [RegMod_Hurdle](https://github.com/l-vice/regmod_hurdle): Regression modeling with Hurdle and GAMLSS frameworks for zero-inflated data. Evaluates promotional, retail, and catalog effects across socioeconomic covariates. (Language: R)
